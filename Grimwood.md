### Oswin Rolm's story

Oswin was your standard warg soldier during the Great War, but when ( either dies in combat, or subject to experiments by the Rykard ) his soul was lost in the nether. After years of wandering, he was able to find the portal opened by the alchemists. Without a physical body though, he returned to Akenland as a ghost, struggling to stay tethered to this plane. He traveled Akenland as a spectator in search of someone powerful enough to help or even see him. Eventually he found a tropical island, inhabited by a primitive society who had isolated themselves from the conflicts of the great nations. They were a very spiritual and ritualistic group. The barrier between spirits and the living was ever so thinner here, as they would often commune with the spirits of their ancestors. The tribesmen were able to see Oswin’s spirit, and the damage it had endured in the nether. While initially weary of this unknown guest, who was far more physical than their ancestors spirits, they began to leave offerings for Oswin. In time, the rituals of the tribesmen healed Oswin’s damaged soul, but he also became bound to the land. As his form became easier to see, Oswin became a sort of guide for these people. Sharing his knowledge from his life, they were able to make great advances in their buildings, technology, and navy. This growth sparked the attention of the current leader of Waramon, a young and driven warg named Kade. This island was located between Sholkingham and Waramon, and Kade knew an ally here would be invaluable in fighting off any potential invaders from the north. 

Upon visiting the island, communication with the locals proved difficult. Kade inquired about their technology, recognizing some of it to be distinctively pre war warg-ish. After providing gifts and showing that Waramon meant no harm, the elders brought him to meet Oswin. Kade immediately recognized Oswin’s origins as a warg and with the permission of the tribe, worked to return his spirit to a physical body. The combination of the tribes spiritual magic and Waramon’s expansive resources, Oswin was reborn into a mortal body. In this body, Oswin retained his memories and matured quickly. Once had had a physical body again, Oswin was no longer bound to the island. He became an ambassador for the island, which became known as Grimwood. Being familiar with both the people of Grimwood and warg culture, their alliance grew strong and was fruitful for both people. Eventually Grimwood became a fully recognized territory of Waramon. Oswin continued to work on Kaiel’s council.



### Possible in-game book for Grimwood

1. A brief history of Grimwood - written by Waramon historians

2. Until recent years, the island now known as Grimwood was thought to be uninhabited by the Clan and deemed unworthy of the vast resources needed to colonize it.
 
3. The climate is very tropical, and the warm oceans around it are home to a great coral reef, abundant with life. On the island is a dense jungle, with the southern portion being swampier, consisting of many mangrove trees. It’s often covered by a thick layer of fog.

4. In recent years, the inhabitants have begun fishing further from their island, this is how Waramon first learned of their presence. It’s speculated that the indigenous people traded with the mainland prior to the war, as there is strong evidence of influence from ancient Waramon culture. 

5. Due to its strategic location, Kade led an expedition to Grimwood in order to meet and befriend the indigenous population. Communication at first proved difficult, but Kade recruited a young warg named Oswin to act as an ambassador. Oswin moved to Grimwood and lived among its people, becoming accustomed with their language and culture.

6. Both Waramon and Grimwood benefited greatly from this relationship. It wasn’t long before it became a recognized colony of Waramon. The people of Grimwood were introduced to new technology, and thus became a fortified Waramon checkpoint between the mainland and Sholkingham.

7. Currently, Grimwood acts as an important port island for Waramon trade ships, and the last safe haven before venturing into Sholkingham. While the indigenous people are still in charge of the island, Oswin is largely recognized as the face of Grimwood in politics. Most of the tribesmen have chosen to integrate with outside society, but a portion live outside the colonized town of Grimwood. There seems to be no animosity from these people, and Oswin is held in high regard by all the elders of the tribe. 

8. Grimwood also exports a significant amount of bamboo and cocoa given its size. The locals rely primarily on fishing for food, but farming has become more popular since being colonized.
